# Senior-Unity-Project
Senior Year of High School required a year long project. I created a Unity game with a partner(Reuben). We created a zombie turn-based game using elements from pokemon and into the breach. I am developing all the code and he is creating all the art. This is my second time working with c#, but I am still learning 50 things at a time.
